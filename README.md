- `bot_token` : get your robot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) (or if you don't have, make one there)
- `proxy` : the proxy is `None` by default but if you want to connect to the telegram with proxy, here is the proxy template that you can replace it with your data.
```python
 proxy = {
     "scheme": "socks5",  # "socks4", "socks5" and "http" are supported
     "hostname": "11.22.33.44",
     "port": 1234,
